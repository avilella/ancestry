Allele frequency matrices needed for running iAdmix (hg19 and hg38 positions) from the HapMap3 populations are provided for download in this folder. Download the files and unzip them before running iAdmix. 


### The format of the allele frequency file required as input for iAdmix is as follows:


The first line should start with '#' and has information about the population names/ids. 

#chrom position rsid A1 A2 YRI CHB CHD TSI MKK LWK CEU JPT

Each subsequent line has information about the allele frequencies of the populations and the two alleles for each variant. Note that the allele frequency is the frequency of the 'A1' allele (column 4). It does not matter if it is the minor or major allele.
